# Visualizing Convolutional Neural Network Processes with TensorBoard Embedding Projector

### Project Overview
This project demonstrates the fine-tuning and visualization of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorBoard's Embedding Projector. The primary objective is to classify image data with high accuracy and to visualize the learned vector embeddings, providing insights into how the network processes data at different layers.

### Features
CNN Architecture: A five-layer CNN with 200 million parameters, fine-tuned to achieve a classification accuracy of 98%.
Data Processing: Over 2000 JPG images were processed using OpenCV for resizing, normalization, edge detection, and gray scaling. These preprocessing steps enhanced feature extraction and engineering for better model performance.
Visualization with TensorBoard: Integration of TensorBoard's Embedding Projector to visualize vector embeddings using dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding).
